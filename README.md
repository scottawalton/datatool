A tool to help the Spark team do data imports

Currently has full support for the following sofware exports:

	- ASF
	- MindBody
	- PerfectMind
	- KickSite
	- RainMaker
	- ZenPlanner

For all other exports, I've made scripts to deal with common problems you will encounter when cleaning the Sparktans' data. 

For the time being, this is a console application. 
A GUI made in PyQt5 is coming soon.

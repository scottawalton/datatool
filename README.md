[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/vesiv/datatool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/vesiv/datatool)

datatool is a tool to make cleaning up messy data easier and faster.

Currently has full support for exports from the following sofwares:

	- ASF
	- MemberSolutions
	- MindBody
	- PerfectMind
	- KickSite
	- RainMaker
	- ZenPlanner

For all other data, I've made operations to deal with common problems you will encounter when cleaning it.

datatool is cross-platform and supports CSV and Excel files.

<h3>Contributions:</h3>

Due to PyQt's use of CamelCase, the GUI files use mixedCase for functions and CamelCase for classes.
